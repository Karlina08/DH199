### *Creating Data Visualizations in Tableau*
* **Step 1:** Ensure your Data is Extracted
  *<img width="1089" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-02 at 10 55 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79784875/166410057-c61417c8-3fc1-4709-acf1-9bbbcaa91b28.png">

* **Step 2:** Click on "Sheet 1" to Access Data Visualization Dashboard 
  * <img width="1118" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-02 at 10 59 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79784875/166410282-5b3b1537-ca8b-45df-9c5e-0dbf0dccf232.png">

* **Step 3:** Drag Desired Variables Under "Table" into Respective Rows and Columns. This will create a data visualization. 
  * <img width="1275" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 9 11 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79784875/166492539-267ad8c4-6b88-42c5-9e42-cce0deb8f57c.png">

 ### *Analyzing Basic Data Visualizations*
* Once you create your desired data visualizations, you can begin analyzing the data by posing questions around your KPI's you chose to analyze. For this tutorial our chosen KPI was the number of likes. 

<img width="1275" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 9 11 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79784875/166492539-267ad8c4-6b88-42c5-9e42-cce0deb8f57c.png">

*Through this data visuzation, we are able to see that the greatest number of likes acquired was through a post at 4:22pm. Similarly, the 2nd highest post that recieved the highest number of likes was posted around the same time (4:58pm). As a result, this data visuzation uncovers a potential posting time for our account. 
* Now, we are able to dig further into the content and consider other variables such as: 
  * What medium were these posts? Were they videos, static images, carousels, Reels, etc.?
  * Were any of these posts associated with a specific campaign? 
  * What tags or hashtags were used to garner greater visability? 
  * What are commenters saying about the post. What are their reactions? 

* These discussions allow marketers to make informed decsions about future social media posts and marketing campaigns and improve upon their existing strategies.
